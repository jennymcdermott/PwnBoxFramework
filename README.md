An easy to use library designed for making hacking software and game hacks quicker to develop on Windows.

The external/executable hack mode offers a DirectX 11 renderer that is compatible with ImGui for DirectX 11.
The internal hack offers a basic set of tools related to reading/writing game memory.
The library also offers the user to create their own Dll injector using the Dll Injector mode.

This is currently offering a very basic set of tools for those who are interested, however, suggestions can be made as well as the user's 
own changes to add more functionality to the library. 

For an example of how one can use this library to make a Dll Injector, see the project titled "PwnBoxInjector"
For a dll hack, see PwnBoxDll (2022-18-07: Currently it's just empty but more will be added soon)

For more information, see PwnBoxFramework.h as to some other settings,
as well as how to get it to compile a Dll for those who may need that.
